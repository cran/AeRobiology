# AeRobiology version 2.0

## Major changes in version 2.0

* Two new functions for hourly data processing added: **plot_hour()** and **plot_heathour()**.  

* A new data set about 3-hourly concentrations from an automatic pollen system (BAA500) have been added: **data("POMO_pollen")**.  

* Added a tutorial in RPubs:  **http://rpubs.com/Picornell/AeRobiology** and a vignette.

* **Interpollen()** method = "neighbour" colnames homogenized.  

* Homogenized the name of the functions: **ps_plot -> plot_ps; trend_plot -> analyse_trend; trends -> plot_trend; qualitycontrol -> quality_control; hour_plot -> plot_hour; summary_plot -> plot_summary; summary_normplot -> plot_normsummary**  

* Homogenized the name of the data sets: **munich** -> **munich_pollen**; **POMO_pollen**  

* Additional **examples** added.  

* Function **trend_plot()** updated changing the visualization of the slopes of the trends in end.date and start.date.  

* Deleted **global assignment** (<<-) in all functions.  

* Eliminated import of **depreciated packages**: *reshape2* and *plyr*. Substituted by active packages *dplyr*, *tidyr* and *purr*.

* **export.result** and **export.plot** arguments have been eliminated in functions when unnecessary (e.g. interpollen()) and set to *FALSE* by default in all functions.  

* Name of arguments have been homogenized among functions (e.g. **plot -> export.plot**)

* Plots displayed by default, but not exported.
  
* Eliminated **prints** of progress messages when unnecessary (e.g. functions interpollen() and plot_trend()). In some functions such as calculate_ps(), this functionality is very relevant.

* New argument **"result"** added to some functions (e.g. interpollen(), calculate_ps(), plot_hour(), analyse_trend()). This argument allows the user to decide which result want to be produced by the function e.g. (result = "table" or result = "plot").  

* Input data are always formatted to data.frame (**data <- data.frame(data)**).  

* Fixed bug in function interpollen()


# AeRobiology version 1.0

### Changes in AeRobiology version 1.0.3

* Import the packages: *purrr*, *colorspace* and *httpuv*

* Function trend_plot() updated with extra information and better visualization of "significant" argument.

* Change the "maintainer" to only one of the authors, maintainer role will rotate among the authors.

### Changes in AeRobiology version 1.0.2 

The changes in specific functions are entitled as updates.function() 

#### updates.general 

* Three typos in the documentation (pg. 27, 29, 33, 37).

#### updates.iplot_abundance() 

* added a new argument: *exclude*. *exclude* is a *character* string vector with the names of the pollen types to be excluded from the plot.

#### updates.calculate_ps()

* Updated documentation with default values of the arguments.
* Updated documentation about "natural year". Natural year is also known as "Calendar year", i.e. the period from 1.January to 31.December.

#### updates.iplot_pollen() 

* Fixed bug of date recognition.

#### updates.iplot_pollen() 

* Fixed bug of date recognition.
